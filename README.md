This is a car showroom database; I didn't use MySQL because it's very long to code for and using csv takes lesser time to code and easy to execute
In CSM.py there is a multiline comment, when you're executing for the first time, Uncomment those lines, because they create the files, as you open the file in write mode(if file doesn't exist it will create a new file)
After executing for the first time just comment those lines(if the files already have data, the write mode will delete all those data and rewrite the data you have entered)
